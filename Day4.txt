In the fourth Chapter i learned : ---->

1:-> The human brain in prediction.
2:-> The more automatic a behaviour becomes, the less likely we pay any attention on doing it.
     We suppose that it would done as before it was done and we stop questioning wether we are doing a right or wrong thing.
3:-> One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintainig awareness about what we are actually doing.
4:-> Analyse your day to day task and mark which task is good ,bad or neutral . As waking early in the morning in the good habbit then binge-eating is bad habbit whereas brushing tooth , sleeping as neutral habbits.
5:-> Once You identified the bad habbits and you don't have to forcely change it just observe before doing that habbit.
6:-> For example : If you want to avvoid eating junk food then notice youself on grabbing another biscuit or namkeen and say aloud , " I'm about to eat this, but i don't need it eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health".
7:-> The process of behaviour change always start with awareness of doing it.
8:-> So, observe your daily activities.

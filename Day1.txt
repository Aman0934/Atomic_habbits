In the first chapter i learned that :
1:-> A very very tiny change in the behaviour can 
     sums up to large change when done for the longer period of time.
2:-> Habbits is the doubled edged sword . Bad habbits can easily cut you down as 
     easy as Good Habbits can build you up.
3:-> Practising a good habbit can seems to make no change for the longer period but one day
     it will make the sudden change . As bamboo plant doesn't seems to grow for about years 
     bcz (root are penetrating deeper and getting stronger) but at once it will grow within
     6 weeks bcz it had grown its root perfectly.
4:-> Forget about goals feel about the system the prctise of doing to get to the goal.(Goal is the
     same for winner and loser but the only difference in the system ).
5:-> We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change 
     is the system that cause those results.
6:-> Goals restrict happiness it is like we used to set the line that after achieving that thing i will be 
     happy and relax but about up to then it limits the happiness. Be happy all the time.
7:-> If we fix the goal then after achieving it . We return to our older habbits So, it is better to focus on making 
     us better everyday than to focus on achieving goals instead goal is the result of our daily improvement.
8:-> Habbits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent bettery every-day counts for a 
     long in the long-run.

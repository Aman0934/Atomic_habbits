Summary 
1) The 2nd Law of Behaviour Change is make it attractive
2) The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming
3) Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
4) It is the anticipation of a reward- not the fulfillment of it-that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
5) Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

What i had learned in chapter 6: --->

1)-> Small Changes in the context can lead to large changes in behaviour over time.
2)-> Every Habbit is initiated be a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
3)-> Make the cues of good habbits obivious in your environment.
4)-> Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. The context becomes the cue.
5)->  It is easier to build new habit in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
